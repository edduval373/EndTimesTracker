# Production Fix - Email Save Issue

## Problem
Email save works in development but fails in production even with DATABASE_URL set.

## Root Cause
The issue is likely that:
1. The updated code with better error handling hasn't been deployed to Vercel yet
2. Database connection might be timing out in serverless environment
3. Environment variables might not be available to the function

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Updated Code
```bash
# Push the latest changes to trigger deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Fix database connection for serverless functions"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Check Vercel Function Logs
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Functions" tab
4. Click on `/api/users` function
5. Check logs for specific error messages

### Step 3: Test Database Connection
Visit these URLs in production to test database connectivity:
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/biblical-events` (should work)
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/prophetic-topics` (should work)

If these work, the database connection is fine and the issue is with the users endpoint.

### Step 4: Check Railway Database Status
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Check if database is active (not sleeping)
3. If sleeping, wake it up by making a connection

### Step 5: Force Redeploy
If environment variables aren't being picked up:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Go to "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

## Expected Result
After these steps, the email save should work in production with proper error messages if it still fails.

## Next Steps if Still Failing
1. Check function logs for specific error messages
2. Test database connection directly from Railway
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Consider using a connection pooler if timeouts persist

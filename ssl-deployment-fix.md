# SSL Deployment Issue Diagnosis

## Current Problem
The API endpoints are returning SSL error code 525, which indicates:
- SSL handshake failure between Cloudflare and the origin server
- This is likely a deployment configuration issue, not a database issue

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. SSL Error Code 525
This error means:
- Cloudflare can't establish SSL connection to origin server
- The origin server (Vercel) may have SSL configuration issues
- Certificate mismatch or invalid SSL settings

### 2. Deployment Status
The enhanced logging code may not have been deployed yet, or there's a deployment failure.

## Immediate Solutions

### Solution 1: Check Vercel Deployment Status
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Deployments
2. Check if latest deployment succeeded
3. Look for build errors or warnings

### Solution 2: Cloudflare SSL Settings
1. Go to Cloudflare dashboard for endtimestracker.app
2. Go to SSL/TLS settings
3. Change SSL mode from "Full (strict)" to "Full" or "Flexible"
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate

### Solution 3: Force Redeploy
1. In Vercel dashboard, click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
2. Or push a small change to trigger new deployment

### Solution 4: Check Domain Configuration
1. Verify CNAME record points to correct Vercel deployment URL
2. Check if custom domain is properly configured in Vercel

## Expected Resolution
After fixing SSL configuration:
- API endpoints should return JSON instead of error codes
- Debug endpoint should show database connection status
- Email save functionality should work properly

## Next Steps
1. Fix SSL configuration in Cloudflare
2. Verify Vercel deployment succeeded
3. Test debug endpoint: /api/users?debug=true
4. Test email save functionality

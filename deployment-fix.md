# Deployment Fix for Cloudflare Pages

## The Problem
Cloudflare Pages is trying to run your Express.js server (`node dist/index.js`) instead of serving the static site with Functions I created.

## The Solution
You need to update your Cloudflare Pages project settings:

### Step 1: Update Build Settings in Cloudflare Dashboard
1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages project dashboard
2. Go to Settings > Build & Deploy
3. Update the settings:
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Output directory:** `dist/public`
   - **Root directory:** `/` (leave blank)
   - **Environment variables:** Add `NODE_ENV=production`

### Step 2: Remove Server Configuration
The key issue is that your current deployment is configured to run a Node.js server. Change it to serve static files only.

### Step 3: Test the Functions
The API endpoints I created should work at:
- `/api/biblical-events`
- `/api/prophetic-topics`
- `/api/news-events`

## Files Ready for Deployment
- ✅ `functions/api/biblical-events.ts` - Returns your 6 biblical events
- ✅ `functions/api/prophetic-topics.ts` - Returns your 6 prophetic topics
- ✅ `functions/api/news-events.ts` - Returns empty array
- ✅ `dist/public/` - Static frontend files
- ✅ `cloudflare-pages.json` - Proper configuration
- ✅ `wrangler.toml` - Updated for static deployment

## Alternative: Quick Fix
If the above doesn't work, the fastest solution is to:
1. Deploy to Vercel instead (handles full-stack apps better)
2. Or use Railway for the entire application

Your application is complete and working - it's just a deployment configuration issue.

# Debug Deployment Issues

## Current Status
- ✅ DATABASE_URL is set in Vercel environment variables
- ❌ Email save still failing in production
- ✅ Works in development/preview

## Potential Issues

### 1. Deployment Not Updated
After adding environment variables, you need to trigger a new deployment:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add better database error handling"
git push origin main
```
Or in Vercel dashboard: Go to "Deployments" → Click "Redeploy"

### 2. Database Connection Issues
The database connection might be timing out or failing. Common issues:
- Railway database might be sleeping (need to wake it up)
- Connection pool settings for serverless functions
- SSL certificate issues

### 3. Check Vercel Function Logs
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Functions" tab
4. Click on `/api/users` function
5. Check the logs for detailed error messages

### 4. Test Database Connection
Try accessing another API endpoint first:
- Visit: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/biblical-events`
- If this works, database connection is fine
- If this fails, database issue

## Next Steps
1. Redeploy the project
2. Check Vercel function logs
3. Test other API endpoints
4. Check Railway database status
